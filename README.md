LEARN SQL
New York Restaurants
We have put together a table of restaurants called nomnom and we need your help to answer some questions. Use the SQL commands you just learned and find the best dinner spots in the city.

The schema of this table is available at https://content.codecademy.com/courses/sql-intensive/nomnom.png?_gl=1*hsjzte*_ga*OTUyNjIzODg2OS4xNjc1MDM4MTAw*_ga_3LRZM6TM9L*MTY3NTM2OTE5OC40LjEuMTY3NTM2OTI0Ni4xMi4wLjA.
